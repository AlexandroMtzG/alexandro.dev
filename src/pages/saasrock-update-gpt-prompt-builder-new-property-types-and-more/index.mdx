## Prompt Flow Builder

The biggest and most complex feature in this update is the brand-new Prompt Flow Builder, available for Enterprise users 🚀. This powerful tool empowers you to effortlessly create, manage, and execute GPT prompt templates/flows 🤖.

In the following demo, I just type an _**"idea"**_ and my prompt flow suggests me a website _name_, _domain_, _feature list_, and a _CTA_.

## New Property Types

### Types- Multi-Select & Multi-Text

I've added new property types to help you collect more diverse and specific data. With Multi-Select and Multi-Text properties, you now have greater flexibility in designing your forms and capturing the information you need from users.

### Subtypes

I've also expanded our property subtypes with **Email**, **URL**, **Phone**, **Checkbox Cards**, and **Radio Group Cards**. These subtypes enable you to create more refined and targeted user input fields for a superior user experience.

## System Entities -  TenantSettings

The TenantSettingsRow system entity is now available, providing a centralized location to manage tenant info. This opens the door to creating custom entities for other core models, such as **User**, **Blog Post**, **TenantUser**...

For this, you need to create a custom entity named **"tenantSettings"** as type "System", then just create the fields you want for every account to fill.

## Remix v2 Future Flags

The Remix team is making the migration for v2 so easy with [future flags](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/pages/v2):

> "All v2 APIs and behaviors are available in v1 with Future Flags. They can be enabled one at a time to avoid development disruption of your project. After you have enabled all flags, upgrading to v2 should be a non-breaking upgrade."

I've covered the **v2_meta** and **v2_errorBoundary** flags.

I tried migrating from [remix-run@1.14.3](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/releases/tag/remix%401.14.3) to [remix-run@1.15.0](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/releases/tag/remix%401.15.0). But it has incompatibility issues with [remix-i18n@3.0.0](https://github.com/sergiodxa/remix-i18next/releases/tag/v3.0.0).

Here's a react@18, remix-run@1.15.0, and remix-i18n@5.1.0 if you don't believe I tried 😅: [saasrock-dev-git-remixv2-alexandromtzg.vercel.app](https://saasrock-dev-git-remixv2-alexandromtzg.vercel.app/) **(it has awkward translations)**. So I guess we're going to be stuck with 1.14 until I implement a custom translation solution, or even better, Remix builds a native i18n solution.

## Minor Improvements

**Minor fix [Analytics 🚀]: User Identification**

Now when a user logs in, it will be identified across all Page Views and Events in the Analytics module.
Filtering Page Views by Anon or specific User

**Minor fix [Subscriptions]: Monthly usage by the current period**

Now it calculates the monthly usage based on the current billing period, rather than the calendar month. This change provides a more accurate representation of the tenant's subscription usage.

**Minor improvement [Entity Builder]: Order for Entity Rows**

Now every row can be sorted on the Table autogenerated view.
