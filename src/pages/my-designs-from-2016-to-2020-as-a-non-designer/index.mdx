I've been a developer for almost 9 years, I always found desgin to be tedious work. These are my application designs since 2016.

From Winforms with dragged text boxes without proper design to functional Vue + TailwindCSS components.

## 2016 - Migration from 4GL to Winforms

My dad has this legacy application written on 4GL that looks like this:

<img src={img4gl} alt="4GL application" className="border-3 border-gray-900 rounded-md w-full shadow-md" />

I was still in college when we decided to migrate every .4gl program to Desktop Winforms with C#. It was a bad decision, I know, we should've gone with the Web route. 

The first concept of my Winforms looked like this:

<span className="font-bold">
Absys ERP v0.0.1
</span>
<img src={img1} alt="Absys ERP v0.0.1" className="border-3 border-gray-900 rounded-md w-full shadow-md" />
I know, ugly as hell.

At least we knew the migration wouldn't be as difficult as we thought it'd be.

## 2017 - Improving the desktop app home screen

We tested a few home screens before we were satisfied with the migration, about 450 forms.

<h4>Absys ERP v1.0.0</h4>
<p>Program-based sidebar and a few links of most used programs/features.</p>
<img src={img2} alt="Absys ERP v1.0.0" className="border-3 border-gray-900 rounded-md w-full shadow-md" />

<h4>Absys ERP v1.5.0</h4>
<p>Module-based sidebar and section details of selected module.</p>
<img src={img3} alt="Absys ERP v1.5.0" className="border-3 border-gray-900 rounded-md w-full shadow-md" />

## 2018 - Adding business intelligence dashboards

<h4>Absys ERP v2019.5.0</h4>
<p>Role-based instead and I added a business intelligence dashboard.</p>
<img src={img4} alt="Absys ERP v1.5.0" className="border-3 border-gray-900 rounded-md w-full shadow-md" />

This is the desktop design that stayed.

## 2019 - My first attempt to design on the web

We had a few clients requesting the ability to place orders on their phones, so I prepare myself for web development.

I used [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and [Bootstrap Vue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/) to create a simpler version of the ERP we built on desktop.

I came up with this bubbled and opaque design.

<h4>Absys ERP (Web) v1.0.0</h4>
<p>Only for certain roles such as CEO, Supplier, Seller and Customer</p>
<img src={imgWeb} alt="Absys ERP v1.5.0" className="border-3 border-gray-900 rounded-md w-full shadow-md" />

I had to look for something else, although I loved Vue ❤️.

## 2020 - TailwindCSS to the rescue

Since COVID started, I decided to start working on side projects. This SaaS idea came to mind and I wanted to develop it as quickly as possible.

I realized I had to find a better tool, a more atomic design framework/library.
So before I even wrote a single line of code I bought [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com), copy-pasted a lot of their samples, and modified some bits.

Then I started working on a project called NetcoreSaas, a boilerplate for SaaS development with .NET, Vue, and Tailwind.

After I implemented all features for authentication, multi-tenant, multi-language, multi-theme, multi-database... this was the final design.

<h4>NetcoreSaas</h4>
<p>Landing page (marketing side)</p>
<img src={img6} alt="NetcoreSaas - Landing page (marketing side)" className="border-3 border-gray-900 rounded-md w-full shadow-md" />

<h4>NetcoreSaas</h4>
<p>Organization settings page (app side)</p>
<img src={img7} alt="NetcoreSaas - Organization settings page (app side)" className="border-3 border-gray-900 rounded-md w-full shadow-md" />

## Conclusion

It's clear to me that I can rely on the Tailwind team so I won't ever be alone as I felt with Winforms. I never wanted to go the WPF route I don't know why.

I will still be maintaining the current Winforms ERP, and developing some features here and there, but I'm going to slowly create SaaS applications with this stack.
