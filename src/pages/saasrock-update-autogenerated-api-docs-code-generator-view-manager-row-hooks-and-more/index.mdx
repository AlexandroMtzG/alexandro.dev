May was focused on a ton of improvements (mainly for the ​[Entity Builder​](https://saasrock.com/entity-builder?ref=saasrock.com&utm_content=v0-8-8)):

- ⭐ **Autogenerated API Docs** with Swagger _(OpenAPI)_ and Postman
- ⭐ **Code Generator** support for new types (Multi-select, Range-number...)
- ⭐ New **Entity View Manager** at _/admin/entities/views_
- ⭐ New **Subscriptions** page at _/admin/accounts/subscriptions_
- ⭐ **Row Hooks**: Added functions to customize your BL _(onBeforeGetAll, onBeforeEdit, onAfterEdit...)_

And other minor fixes:

- 🔨 **Yes-Code**: Multi-select missing in generated files #304
- 🔨 **Multi-select** attribute not added to Yes-Code Helper #302
- 🔨 Row Form **Number Input** cannot clear #303
- 🔨 Footer Block needs translations #272
- 🔨 Edit entity gives the wrong path... #268
- 🔨 ActionResultModal no way to set title #264
