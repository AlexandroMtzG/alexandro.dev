[​DataLang​](https://datalang.io/?ref=saasrock.com&utm_content=introducing-datalang), an MVP built this week on top of SaasRock v0.8.8.

Idea: You ask something in natural language, and your database answers you in natural language.

Try the [​demo here​](https://datalang.io/demo?ref=saasrock.com&utm_content=introducing-datalang) or watch the [​video here​](https://www.loom.com/share/1e28c89ed4b54085bdaa848bfd3f782e?sid=86b269ec-7956-4800-9228-4a3f3f902a41).

I want to achieve multiple things with this MVP:

1. Keep building real-world apps with SaasRock to improve it on the fly
2. Keep launching micro-SaaS apps to test the market
3. Use GPT in a real-world use case
4. Market SaasRock

## What Can DataLang Do?

DataLang is designed to make database interaction intuitive and user-friendly. Here's how it works:

1. You set up your data source **connection string**.
2. DataLang fetches all the **schema tables** and columns from your data source.
3. **You ask a question** in natural language, such as _"How many users signed up this month?"_
4. DataLang sends your question to **GPT** _(OpenAI)_.
5. GPT processes your question and generates an **SQL query**.
6. The **SQL query executes** in your database.
7. A **natural language response** is returned.

## Security Measures

### Credential Encryption

I understand the importance of data security. That's why your data source credentials are encrypted before being stored in the DataLang database, and only decrypted before executing SQL. I use [this method](https://gist.github.com/AlexandroMtzG/9e0ebd0751f49e3f6d8b1eac3651195b) to encrypt/decrypt credentials.

### Dangerous SQL Statements Prevention

My prompt engineering method uses 4 prompts:

1. Understanding the end-user question
2. Interpreting the DB schema + making sense of the question
3. Crafting SQL statements (SELECT only)
4. Final SQL safety check

In the 4 steps, the prompts make sure to throw an **"Unsafe question"** error if it identifies dangerous operations, such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, DROP...

## API

Use your account API Keys to send questions in the following format:
