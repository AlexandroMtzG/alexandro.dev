## 1. Full-stack Routes 💽

Everything you need on ONE file. Loader export to get data + Action export to submit forms + a React component to handle UI = SSR in under 100ms.

## 2. Loaders ⌛

Everything you need to load in one function: User state, redirect unauthorized users, i18n translations, SEO meta info…

## 3. Actions ⚡️

Validate form submission, parse array values, perform DB operations, use third-party libraries (eg: send email), and redirect the user when completed.

## 4. Error Boundaries ⚠️

Handle unexpected errors with ErrorBoundary route exports, and expected errors with ClientBoundary exports.

## 5. No more Loading Spinners 💀

Using SPA means that you have to wait for the server to load the data, in the meantime, you need to calm down your users by giving them a loading spinner ↻.

With SSR you get the fully interactive page, with Remix you don't even think about it.

## 6. UI/UX 💅🏻

I don't have to give up everything I've learned with React + Tailwind CSS components, in fact, now I focus more on them to give my users great UI/UX.

## 7. Integrations 🎁

Working with DBs has never been easier with [@prisma](https://twitter.com/prisma) + SQLite for local dev, and [@supabase](https://twitter.com/supabase) for a fast ⚡️ PostgreSQL prod app; combined with [@stripe](https://twitter.com/stripe) and [@postmarkapp](https://twitter.com/postmarkapp), it gives us full power for any SaaS app idea that comes. & of course [@vercel](https://twitter.com/vercel) for hosting 👌

I would not be surprised if the Remix team ([@mjackson](https://twitter.com/mjackson), [@ryanflorence](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence), [@kentcdodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds)) came up with a Vue/Svelte + Remix tech in the near future, making almost every full-stack dev dream come true.
