## Context

Iâ€™ve been a SaaS builder for 3 years now, ever since I learned Tailwind CSS, my design iterations have been a joy.

But [Remix](https://remix.run/) completely changed the game for me, being an SSR-focused framework plus providing [full stack components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RszUDp_yiLI), it allowed me to iterate SaaS development even faster.

## Page Blocks

Iâ€™ve already designed the same Hero Block a few times:

- [SaasRock](https://saasrock.com/?ref=alexandro.dev&utm_content=remix-page-blocks)
- [Factura.so](https://factura.so/?ref=alexandro.dev&utm_content=remix-page-blocks) (built with saasrock)
- [Gumcrm.io](https://gumcrm.io/?ref=alexandro.dev&utm_content=remix-page-blocks) (built with saasrock)
- [NetcoreSaas](https://netcoresaas.com/?ref=alexandro.dev&utm_content=remix-page-blocks)
- [SaasFrontends](https://saasfrontends.com/?ref=alexandro.dev&utm_content=remix-page-blocks)
- [Delega.com.mx](https://delega.com.mx/?ref=alexandro.dev&utm_content=remix-page-blocks) (built with netcoresaas)

![Same Hero Block](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*rfAh4Jh1iI5VpPnaZ6cqwQ.png)

They all have the same structure:

- Headline
- Subheadline
- CTA buttons (primary or secondary)
- An optional top text/link
- An optional bottom text/link

You can understand how this becomes tiring, even with months between each SaaS app development, so it makes sense for me to start abstracting the most common components into a Page Builder.

## Developer Experience

I always focus on great DX first, so this approach lets you design the Landing page blocks by code, and once itâ€™s in production, itâ€™d let you make changes to your blocks by persisting changes in the database (with Prisma).

Hereâ€™s how the Hero block looks:

And hereâ€™s what the Hero Block editor looks like:

## Open Source

I decided to make this bit open source to help other Remix developers iterate faster, or at least provide them a simple page builder, [give it a star](https://github.com/AlexandroMtzG/remix-page-blocks). I can see someone building a full website builder with this project as the base. If you want to check out my other open-source projects, check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/AlexandroMtzG).
