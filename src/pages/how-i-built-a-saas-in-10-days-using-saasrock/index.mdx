July's goal was to [build in public](https://twitter.com/saas_rock/status/1554157251753025537) an actual SaaS for 2 reasons:

- Validate [SaasRock](http://saasrock.com/) as a production-ready SaaS starter
- Launch my own SaaS

## The problem

In Mexico, there are already a lot of invoicing platforms _([QuickBooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/), [CONTPAQi](https://www.contpaqi.com/), [Aspel](https://www.aspel.com.mx/)â€¦)_, but none are **simple** and **robust** at the same time, and there's not a single platform that offers taxpayers the service to generate invoices for their receipts.

## The solution

I called it Factura.so, like Notion.so, but with **Factura** _(Invoice in Spanish)_.
It has 2 main features:

- Forward all your invoices to yourcompany@factura.so
- Submit your receipts and we'll generate the invoice for you

With these 2 features, the headline became:

> [Factura.so](https://factura.so/)â€Š-â€ŠThe only platform you need to request and receive invoices.

## How I builtÂ it

I documented my journey in a youtube series called **"Building a SaaS with SaasRock"**. Here's the summary of each video, or [click here](https://saasrock.com/tutorials/building-a-saas-with-saasrock) to view them all.

## The endÂ result

### Landing page

I need to communicate that with this platform, you could **Request** and **Receive** invoices, hence the emphasis:

### Dashboard

3 blocks here:

- **Summary**: All my XMLs, Receipts, and Invoices _(from 30 days to date)_.
- **Receipts**: Stats by workflow state _(Pending, Invalid, or Processed)_.
- **XMLs**: The SaaS is around XMLs, so it makes sense to show the last 10.

### My Receipts

Using SaasRock's Entity Builder I created 3 views:

- **Pending**: A table of _pending_ receipts
- **All**: A table of _all_ receipts
- **Photos**: A grid of _all_ receipt photos

### My XMLs

XMLs can be created:

- **Manually**: User uploads anÂ **.xml** file
- **Email**: Send or forward emails withÂ **.xml** files to _yourcompany@factura.so_
- **Sync**: By adding a Taxpayer Credential _(see My Invoices)_.

### My Invoices

If a user uploaded their Taxpayer Credential, I sync their invoices with the [SAT.WS](http://sat.ws/) API:

### My Emails

SaasRock comes with an out-of-the-box inbound emails feature, I use it to create XML Entity Rows if there are attachments of typeÂ **.xml** andÂ **.pdf**.

### My Subscription (prices in MXN)

The business model is simple:

- **Test**: A freemium plan to test all the main features
- **Essential**: For small companies
- **Business**: For medium/large companies

## What's Next for SaasRock?

Right now I have post-launch depression, where I don't know what I'm going to do next ðŸ¤£. But I have written down some ideas:
