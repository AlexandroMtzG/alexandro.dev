Thank you for trying out my [Remix SaaS kit](https://alexandromg.gumroad.com/l/Remix-SaaS-Boilerplate)! I did not expect so many downloads, so I thought I this Quickstart Tutorial.

If you like what you got, consider giving it a 5-star on Gumroad :).

Introducing Remix SaaS kit v0.0.1.

## 1) Core Concepts

Before you follow the tutorial, I want you to know why I built it the way it is.

### 1.1) Tenant

I wanted to make an app where 1 email could have multiple accounts, like Notion.

A Tenant has its own:

- Stripe Customer ID - Created at **_/register_**

- Stripe Subscription ID - Created at **_/app/settings/subscription_**

- Tenant Members - Created at **_/app/settings/members_**

- Workspaces - Created at **_/app/settings/workspaces_**

### 1.2) Workspace

This depends on your SaaS implementation. For example, I have a SaaS where the Workspace is a Legal Company, and another one where each Workspace represents the Current Project. It's up to you.

A Workspace has its own:

- Workspace Members

- Links to other Workspaces

- Employees

### 1.3) Link

You can delete this in your implementation, but it's there if you need it.

I wanted to make a SaaS where my users could like accounts with other users. For example, Workspace X from Tenant A, wants to share information with Workspace Z from Tenant B. On this implementation, there's a direction, where one Workspace is a **_Provider_** and the other one a **_Client_**.

A Link has its own:

- Contracts

### 1.4) Contracts

You can delete this in your implementation, but it's there if you need it.

On every SaaS kit, I implemented a Contracts app, on which two linked workspaces can share 1 contract, and it belongs to both of them. Also, you can see how PDF upload/preview work.

A Contract references:

- Linked Workspace Members

- Current Workspace Employees

### 1.5) Employee

Simple **CRUD** demo.

### 1.6) TenantId, WorkspaceId, and LinkId fields

Since this boilerplate is designed to support multiple tenants, each with its own workspaces, you have to implement these fields (on your **prisma** calls) on every Entity you create, hence the **_Contracts_** and **_Employees_** demo. I plan to implement an automatic way of doing this, [subscribe](https://alexandromg.gumroad.com/?_ga=2.214548439.19719977.1648435244-1074079387.1642355847&_gl=1*kefbrg*_ga*MTA3NDA3OTM4Ny4xNjQyMzU1ODQ3*_ga_6LJN6D94N6*MTY0ODU4MjU1OC43Mi4xLjE2NDg1ODU3MjMuMA..) or [follow me](https://twitter.com/AlexandroMtzG) to stay tuned!

## 2) Quickstart Tutorial

Follow these steps to see what Remix SaaS kit can do.

### 2.1) Requirements:

- [Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)

- [Postmark account](https://account.postmarkapp.com/sign_up) _(use REMIXSAASPOSTMARK code for -20%)_

- [Supabase account](https://supabase.com/) _(you can use your own [Prisma-supported-database](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-reference/supported-databases) provider)_

- [Formspree account](https://formspree.io/register) (optional)

### 2.2) Git

Open the downloaded project folder _(I'm using VSCode)_, open a Terminal and run:

```
git init
git add .
git commit -am "initial"
```

### 2.3) Environment file:

Rename the `.env.example` file to just `.env`.

![.env file](https://yahooder.sirv.com/saasfrontends/remix/blog/quickstart/env.png)

Update the _REMIX_SESSION_SECRET_ value to something secure ~~(like abc123)~~.

Set the _REMIX_ADMIN_EMAIL_ with your email and something random for _REMIX_ADMIN_PASSWORD_.

![Credentials](https://yahooder.sirv.com/saasfrontends/remix/blog/quickstart/credentials.png)

Get your [Stripe Secret Key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) and set it to _REMIX_STRIPE_SK_.

![Stripe Secret Key (use your own)](https://yahooder.sirv.com/saasfrontends/remix/blog/quickstart/stripe.png)

Open your [Postmark Servers Dashboard](https://account.postmarkapp.com/servers), select or create your server, click on API Tokens and set it to _REMIX_POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN_.

![Postmark Test Server (use your own)](https://yahooder.sirv.com/saasfrontends/remix/blog/quickstart/postmark.png)

(Optional) Open your [Formspree Forms Dashboard](https://formspree.io/forms), select or create your form, click on Integration, and set the Form's endpoint to _REMIX_INTEGRATIONS_CONTACT_FORMSPREE_.

![Formspree Test Form (use your own)](https://yahooder.sirv.com/saasfrontends/remix/blog/quickstart/formspree.png)

Up to this point, you should have only 1 commit:

![.env.example was renamed to .env, but .env is ignored by git](https://yahooder.sirv.com/saasfrontends/remix/blog/quickstart/env-commit.png)

### 2.4) Database:

I highly recommend building your app first with SQLite, then moving to something like PostgreSQL/MySQL.

If you're not using SQLite, identify your [database connection string format](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors) and set it to the _DATABASE_URL_ environment variable.

![PostgreSQL URL format](https://yahooder.sirv.com/saasfrontends/remix/blog/quickstart/database.png)

_IMPORTANT: If you're using Supabase and you will host your app on a Serverles environment like Vercel or AWS Lambda, [use the Connection Pooling String as specified here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/integrations/prisma#connection-pooling-with-supabase). As you can see, use the normal PostgreSQL connection string when creating, migrating, and seeding the database with Prisma, but use the Connection Pooling String when deploying to a Serverless environment._

Open the `schema.prisma` file, and set the corresponding database provider ([sqlite](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/sqlite), [postgresql](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/postgresql), [mysql](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/mysql), [sqlserver](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/sql-server), [mongodb](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/mongodb), or [cockroachdb](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/cockroachdb)).

![Since I'm using Supabase, I set postgresql](https://yahooder.sirv.com/saasfrontends/remix/blog/quickstart/database-provider.png)

Run the first migration and seed the database using this command:

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

You should get the following output:

![Prisma Migration and Seed](https://yahooder.sirv.com/saasfrontends/remix/blog/quickstart/database-migration.png)

If for any reason, the migration was created successfully but did not seed the database, use the following command:

```
npx prisma db seed
```

If you mess up the database, you can always reset it with Prisma, or drop the tables manually:

![Drop Tables](https://yahooder.sirv.com/saasfrontends/remix/blog/quickstart/database-drop.png)

**DROP TABLES Script:**

```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "_prisma_migrations";
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "Joke";
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "ContractMember";
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "ContractActivity";
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "ContractEmployee";
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "Contract";
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "Employee";
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "Link";
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "SubscriptionFeature";
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "SubscriptionPrice";
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "SubscriptionProduct";
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "TenantUserInvitationWorkspace";
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "TenantUserInvitation";
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "WorkspaceUser";
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "Workspace";
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "TenantUser";
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "Tenant";
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "User";
```

Up to this point, you should have 3 commits:

![Files generated by the Prisma migration](https://yahooder.sirv.com/saasfrontends/remix/blog/quickstart/database-commit.png)

### 2.4) App:

If you haven't already, install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run the application:

```
npm run dev
```

Open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000), you should see the landing page:

![Dark mode landing page](https://yahooder.sirv.com/saasfrontends/remix/blog/quickstart/landing.png)

Click on the **Dark/Light mode Toggle**:

![Light mode landing page](https://yahooder.sirv.com/saasfrontends/remix/blog/quickstart/landing-light.png)

Get rid of the `<TopBanner />` component, or customize it if you're advertising something, like me ([other SaaS kits](https://alexandromg.gumroad.com/)).

![TopBanner.tsx component (used on root.tsx)](https://yahooder.sirv.com/saasfrontends/remix/blog/quickstart/topbanner.png)

Go to the **_/pricing_** page and click on Go to **_/admin/pricing_**.

_NOTE: Before we persist the Prices to the database, you can play with the pricing by modifying the `plans.server.ts` file._

![Warning Banner - prices are being loaded from a file, not from your database](https://yahooder.sirv.com/saasfrontends/remix/blog/quickstart/warning.png)

Log in as your admin user. If successful, it will redirect you with a Session Cookie to **_/admin/pricing_**.

Here we can persist the prices to our database and to our Stripe account by clicking the orange button.

![Admin: Pricing management (CREATE only, you cannot UPDATE nor DELETE)](https://yahooder.sirv.com/saasfrontends/remix/blog/quickstart/admin-pricing.png)

_NOTE: If you've persisted the prices to your DB and Stripe, but you want to make a change, you could **manually DELETE** the records on the following tables: "SubscriptionFeature", "SubscriptionPrice" and "SubscriptionProduct"._

![DELETE pricing script](https://yahooder.sirv.com/saasfrontends/remix/blog/quickstart/pricing-drop.png)

Now that our prices exist, go to **_/register_** and create a sample account (with a real email to get the **_Welcome_** email).

![Register page](https://yahooder.sirv.com/saasfrontends/remix/blog/quickstart/register.png)

You should get a welcome email.

![Welcome email](https://yahooder.sirv.com/saasfrontends/remix/blog/quickstart/welcome-email.png)

You will be redirected to the Dashboard:

![Dashboard](https://yahooder.sirv.com/saasfrontends/remix/blog/quickstart/dashboard.png)

That's all you need to get started using the boilerplate. And of course, you could also follow the `README.md` file.
