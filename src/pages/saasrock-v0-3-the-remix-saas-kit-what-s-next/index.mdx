I'm planning to start my own SaaS this month. June was packed wit a lot of features, such as Roles and Permissions, Row Visibility, Tags/Tasks/Comments, Workflows, Filters, Kanban and API usage.

Ever since I started programming, 12 years ago, I wanted to build SaaS applications. But it was not until recent months that I finally feel confident enough to make a successful business with SaasRock's v0.3.2 release, [click here to get it](https://alexandromg.gumroad.com/l/SaasRock)!

### June Recap

Here's a summary of what was added last month:

- **Roles** and **Permissions** - For views and actions
- Row **Visibility** - Private, account members, specific roles, specific groups, or public
- Row **Tags**, **Tasks**, **Comments**, and **Workflows** - For all custom entity rows
- Row **Filters** with URL - employees?q=luna or employees?firstName=luna
- Simple **Kanban** board component
- **API** usage - Limit API calls based on current subscription

### July Plan - My first SaaS app with SaasRock

What better way to know what SaasRock is missing than actually building a SaaS. Today I'll start building an Invoicing SaaS platform using SaasRock to validate the framework - with 3 main features:

- **Receipts** - Upload your expense receipts
- **Invoices** - Create invoices for your customers
- **Emails** - Convert supplier emails to invoices

It will be a SaaS for Mexican companies, but surely some features that I need will be added to the SaasRock Enterprise ðŸš€ (and some to SaasRock Core ðŸª¨).

I'll announce the end result on July 31st on my Twitter [@AlexandroMtzG](https://twitter.com/AlexandroMtzG).

### A few other things:

- If you need help building your SaaS or don't have the time, check the [Founder's Edition](https://alexandromg.gumroad.com/l/SaasRockDevelopment) (4 left).
- I'll improve **Workflows** _(e.g. email notifications, rules...)_, **CRM** _(automatically create contacts for registered users, send emails...)_ this month, and other issues _(check out the [issues roadmap](https://saasrock.com/docs/roadmap))_.
