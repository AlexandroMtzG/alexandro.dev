This is a series where I‚Äôll be documenting the migration of a Document and Contract SaaS application I built 2 years ago, [D√©lega](https://delega.com.mx/), to [SaasRock](https://saasrock.com/?ref=hashnode&utm_content=saasrock-delega-part-1) v0.8.

[SaasRock‚Äôs](https://saasrock.com/?ref=hashnode&utm_content=saasrock-delega-part-1) framework (or boilerplate) does not entirely build your SaaS but eases its development, the purpose of this tutorial is to show you my thought process when building apps, but you can take any approach you want.

As with every real-world project I build with SaasRock, both the Core and Enterprise edition will be benefited from the added features that are needed in this app. If you‚Äôre a SaasRock Enterprise subscriber, ask for access to the repository.

If you don‚Äôt know what SaasRock is: this week I reached 1,000 hours working on it:

## Chapter 1

1. Requirements
2. Initial SaasRock Core Setup
3. Deployment to Vercel and Supabase

![Cover](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*OCOGJfpLCborva3ejLy4eg.webp)

## 1. Requirements

I‚Äôll try to keep the MVP as simple as possible:

- There are 2 types of Accounts _(aka Tenants)_: Clients and Providers
- Clients link with Providers
- Providers upload **Documents**, and Clients can access them
- Clients or Providers upload a shared **Contract**
  Contracts have signatories and workflow states _(Draft, Pending, Signed)_

This is the basic app which we can build with SaasRock‚Äôs Entity Builder in minutes, but we‚Äôll need to add custom functionality to:

- Sign Contracts digitally using [Dropbox Sign](https://www.dropbox.com/hellosign) _(formerly HelloSign)_
- Scan uploaded Documents with OCR using [Tesseract.js](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js)

## 2. Initial SaasRock Setup

The first thing I‚Äôm going to do is create an empty private repository called **saasrock-delega**, clone it on my machine, and set up **SaasRock Core Edition** as the upstream to pull the latest changes _(currently v0.8)_.

We can later switch to the **Enterprise Edition** which has Onboarding, Analytics, and a few other features _([compare them here](https://saasrock.com/core-vs-enterprise?ref=hashnode&utm_content=delega-part-1))_.

```
git clone https://github.com/AlexandroMtzG/saasrock-delega.git
git remote add upstream https://github.com/AlexandroMtzG/saasrock.git
git remote set-url --push upstream no_push
git pull upstream main
npm install
```

Now let‚Äôs push the initial changes to the repository:

```
git branch -M main
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git push origin main
```

Before starting the app, we need a few required environment variables set up. So I‚Äôm going open the project in VS Code (with `code .`), duplicate the file _*.env.example*_ as _*.env*_, and set the following values:

```
APP_NAME="D√©lega"
SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
DOMAIN_NAME=delega.saasrock.com
API_ACCESS_TOKEN={PRIVATE GUID}
DATABASE_URL="postgres://{USER}:{PASSWORD}@localhost:5432/saasrock-delega"
SESSION_SECRET={PRIVATE RANDOM STRING}
ADMIN_EMAIL=alex.martinez@absys.com.mx
ADMIN_PASSWORD={PRIVATE PASSWORD}
```

Run the Prisma migrations and seed the database with the following command ‚Äî make sure to have a local Postgres server running, I use [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/) for Mac:

```
npx prisma migrate dev
```

‚ö† If for any reason the migration/schema was applied to the database but it was not seeded, you can run `npx prisma db seed` if that also fails, you can try deleting the _*node_modules*_ folder and the _*package-lock.json*_ file, reinstall and retry. And if the migration did not execute, try with `npx prisma migrate reset`.

Now we can run the app using `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:3000:

## 3. Deployment to Vercel and Supabase

I want to create a fast development workflow, so I like deploying the first commit to a real URL with a live database.

What I usually do first, is apply the [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) migrations to the production database and seed it ‚Äî I can later reset it when needed, so I need to create a Supabase project/database first.

_IMPORTANT: When you create the Supabase and Vercel projects, make sure to select the nearest regions to each other._

### Supabase

Create a [Supabase](https://app.supabase.com/projects) project/database, go to the project settings, and set these _*.env*_ variables:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://{USER}:{PASSWORD}@{HOST}:5432/postgres" # LOCAL
SUPABASE_API_URL={Copy the Supabase Project URL}
SUPABASE_KEY={Copy the API Key service_role, secret}
```

Keep in mind that the connection string is [different in production](https://saasrock.com/docs/learning-center/guides/database/supabase) for serverless environments:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgres://{USER}:{PASSWORD}@{HOST}:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true" # PRODUCTION
```

Using this supabase connection string (temporarily) we can apply our database schema and seed it with default data _(like the admin user, which in my case is alex.martinez@absys.com.mx)_ `npx prisma migrate dev`, you should get the following command line result:

![Initial Migration + Seeding Database](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*-gT-rM-r6TCvgoxWYy_nVQ.webp)

### Vercel

Create a project in Vercel and import the recently created repository.

Before clicking ‚ÄúDeploy‚Äù, make sure to set up the production environment variables. Remember that the `DATABASE_URL` [is different](https://saasrock.com/docs/learning-center/guides/database/supabase) _(‚Äúpostgres://‚Äù instead of ‚Äúpostgresql://‚Äù, pgbouncer=true, and port 6543)_, in my case these are my production variables:

```
APP_NAME="D√©lega"
SERVER_URL=https://delega.saasrock.com
DOMAIN_NAME=delega.saasrock.com
API_ACCESS_TOKEN={PRIVATE GUID}
DATABASE_URL="postgres://{USER}:{PASSWORD}@{HOST}:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true" # PRODUCTION
SESSION_SECRET={PRIVATE RANDOM STRING}
```

For now, we don‚Äôt need the other _*.env*_ values. Now I have the first deployment successful üü¢:

![Vercel](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*UGKtVTIOU46UQqykYjqgJA.webp)

If you‚Äôre not using a custom domain, your `SERVER_URL` and `DOMAIN_NAME` should be _*‚Äúhttps://{YOUR_PROJECT}.vercel.app"*_ and _*‚Äú{YOUR_PROJECT}.vercel.app‚Äù*_ respectively.

But if you are using a custom domain, go to your project‚Äôs settings at https://vercel.com/{ORG}/{PROJECT}/settings/domains and add your domain or subdomain, and create the CNAME record in your DNS records _([don‚Äôt use Proxy, but DNS only](https://vercel.com/guides/can-i-use-a-proxy-on-top-of-my-vercel-deployment))_.

![Vercel CNAME](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*BKQXUZWbL5AlQD4nNCyB5Q.webp)

![Cloudflare CNAME](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*zCXu1l1CmidjNI8Uyud9Mw.webp)

And give the records some time to propagate.

---

## End Result

Now I have my deployed application at [delega.saasrock.com](https://delega.saasrock.com/?ref=hashnode&utm_content=saasrock-delega-part-1) so I don‚Äôt have to worry about deploying at the end of this series.

By the way, remember to delete the test users at /admin/users, especially the _guest@admin.com_ user that would have access to our admin portal üòÖ _(or just change the password in the **prisma/seed.ts** file before seeding)_.

## What‚Äôs next?

[In chapter 2](https://alexandromtzg.medium.com/building-a-saas-for-contracts-and-documents-with-saasrock-part-2-signing-contracts-with-dropbox-23a28cafecb7), I‚Äôll create the **Contracts** module:

- Modeling the Entity
- Autogenerating the Files for CRUD
- Creating the Signers Components
- Implementing the Signers Model
- Implementing the Dropbox Sign Node.js SDK
