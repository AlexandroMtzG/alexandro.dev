## Cookie Consent üç™‚Ää-‚ÄäCore¬†feature ü™®

A lot of third-party tools use cookies to store private user data, and that could break compliance rules in some countries _(and we don't like being tracked)_.

SaasRock's v0.5.0 comes with a cookie banner + settings that ask your users to allow the website cookie usage, and their purpose.

### Cookie Banner

A banner will show up at every page until the user selects its preferences.

![Cookie Banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8606530/185702794-ffca8aa9-11cc-47d9-8c77-52902e224aa0.png)

### Cookie Settings

If the user wishes to inspect each cookie, they can open the cookie settings modal.

![Cookie Settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8606530/185702743-ede6850b-1258-4c84-b9a3-491e3f944bdc.png)

### Usage

Ever time you add a new cookie information, it will ask the user to allow _(or deny)_ it.

Here are the initial **Cookie Categories** at `app/application/cookies/CookieCategory.ts`:

![Cookie Categories](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*X3oX4AebYpgKyxT2yX6XwA.png)

For every cookie you'll use, add its details at `app/application/cookies/ApplicationCookies.ts`:

![Application Cookies](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*93oyQOr4zewrsbm7iFVHAg.png)

Now, you can check for cookie consent. Let's see how we can set the Google Analytics script at `root.tsx` inside the `body` tag - using the `ADVERTISEMENT` cookie category:

![Google Analytics](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*3AwWviL85Vh2dSUUrXErBg.png)

I'm using the function _CookieHelper.hasConsent(...)_ by passing the current **user session** and the **cookie category**. This function can be used both on the backend _(loaders and actions)_ and on the frontend _(React components)_.

## Built-in Analytics üìà‚Ää-‚ÄäEnterprise feature üöÄ

Now that cookies are set üç™, your site will track anonymously for page views and actions.

### Why a built-in analytics solution?

SaasRock does not intent to invent the wheel, there are great analytics solutions out there, both [free](https://simpleanalytics.com/) and [powerful](https://plausible.io/). But SaasRock‚Äôs main goal is to have everything you need when building SaaS applications, at least in a minimal way.

But the main reason I‚Äôm starting to build a built-in analytics solution is to have a built-in **Affiliates and Referrals** program, and for that I need to identify UTM tags within SaasRock/your-SaaS _(although I know nothing about how to use them yet, so expect a lot of bugs üòÖ)_.

### What does SaasRock store?

Unlike privacy-friendly tools like [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/) or [SimpleAnalytics](https://simpleanalytics.com/), SaasRock DOES use a cookie _saasrock_analytics_.

But this doesn't mean that SaasRock stores private data, I tried to store on the database as few data as possible:

- **Cookie**: to identify unique visitors
- **HTTP Referrer**
- **Browser**
- **Operating System**: I'm using the [platform](https://github.com/bestiejs/platform.js) library
- **UTM tags**: source, medium, campaign, content, and term

SaasRock does not store the **IP** or the raw **user agent**.

Here's the **AnalyticsUniqueVisitor** database ([prisma](http://prisma.io/)) model:

**Public Analytics** - You can have the analytics data publicly available.

### What's next for Analytics?

Of course this is _*v0.0.0.0.0.1*_ of the analytics feature, but I needed a built-in Analytics starter in order to start developing the upcoming Enterprise feature for **Affiliates and Referrals**, so I need to make sure that page views are tracked correctly.

**Planned**:

- Stats Charts, [like SimpleAnalytics](https://simpleanalytics.com/)

**Optional**:

- Use an API to identify the user's country and city with its IP.
- I'll try to figure out how to identify unique visitors without using cookies, [like Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/data-policy#how-we-count-unique-users-without-cookies).
